I am Isaac Woodward, a graduate mechanical engineering student studying robotics but with a broad engineering background. I have experience in 3D modeling, embedded systems, AI/ML, computer vision, finite element modeling/analysis, among other areas. I hope this portfolio gives a good introduction to my skills and my past work!
